The KeyboardFunc is used to switch between Ortho and Perspective view of an object. The mouseFunc is used to start the game, Left click will result in user selecting  O thus becoming second player while Right Click will result in user selecting X and becoming first player.

Two cylinders are used for making the X and one Torus is used for drawing O. The text on the screen is kept using glutBitmapCharacter function. Lightening function is also used in this project. 

The Timer Function is used for spinning the cube and updating the screen after every click so that the input from cpu/user can be seen in screen. Other than thsese functions we have used other basic openGL and C codes and functions. The CPU move logic is carried out in c.
